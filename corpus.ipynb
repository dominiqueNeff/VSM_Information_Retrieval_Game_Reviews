In addition we may collect your age gender date of birth zip code hardware configuration console ID software products played survey data purchases IP address and the systems you have played on. We may combine the information with your personal information and across other computers or devices that you may use.\"Yeah nah... I've uninstalled this game two times and I've got tons of storage so I usually don't do that.The first time was because the game automatically installed with the game \"Redshell\" a spyware program that steals your information for ad targeting.The second because their new EULA (which again you agree to by having the game installed) gives them permission to access every bit of personal information your PC can give them.Both times just happened to be at the same time their big (very expensive) expansion DLC comes out. It's clearly no coincidence that they put this garbage in at the same time the most users have the game installed. It's a disgusting and predatory business practice and it makes me feel just disappointed. The greed in video game developers today is just sickening.If you really want to buy this game go buy Civ 5. It's a great game some say much better than this one and the best part is they aren't updating it anymore. So the game is okay I think Civ 5 AND 4 were better so I would recommend those over this. That the previous games did things \"better\" is of course personal opinion yet there is another reason I would not recommend this.There is a disturbing attempt to change a personally owned game into the new \"Games as a service\" by forcing an updated user agreement that did not exist at the launch of the game and if you like having your files personal or dont want to agree to give them the information they want then you cant play the game anymore. Thats a very shady move. To think that all they need to do to take away ownership or how you play a game no matter how old the game is is just to update a new user agreement.That would be like Nintendo in the 80's locking a NES copy of Super Mario with radio waves and not letting you play it unless you mailed them a signed letter. The letter saying that you agreed to hand over your address book and photo album if they decided they wanted it in return for letting you play your... ummm actually now its THEIR game. Thats insane id rather vote with my wallet and play a less intrusive game.\n",
